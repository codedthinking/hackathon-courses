## Intelligence is Becoming a Commodity

The AI market has fundamentally shifted. There are now many high-quality models competing intensely on both capability and price.

> "AI intelligence is becoming a commodity. Lots of competition and very cheap."

This isn't just marketing speak. Look at the numbers:

| Model | Quality | Price (per million output tokens) |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| MiniMax M2.5 | Very good | $1 (often free) |
| Kimi K2.5 | Very good | $1 |
| GLM-5 | Very good | ~$1 |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | Best | $25 |

The best model costs 25x more than very good alternatives. For most tasks, the difference isn't worth it.

## Rankings Change Weekly

On Open Router, you can see which models are most popular:

> "MiniMax M2.5 is the most popular model... why is it the most popular? Because that week it was free."

New models get released constantly. Chinese models (MiniMax, Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek) are matching or exceeding Western models at a fraction of the cost. This isn't about geopolitics—it's about competition driving down prices.

## What This Means for You

1. **Don't lock in** to any single provider
2. **Prices will keep falling** - what costs $25 today will cost $1 next year
3. **Test multiple models** for your specific use case
4. **The "best" model changes** - stay flexible

## Practical Recommendation

For most research tasks:
- **Daily work**: Kimi K2.5 or MiniMax M2.5 (cheap, good quality)
- **Writing tasks**: GPT (still writes better prose)
- **Complex reasoning**: Opus (when you really need it)

The key insight: you shouldn't need to think about which model to use for most tasks. They're all good enough. Save the expensive models for when you actually need them.
